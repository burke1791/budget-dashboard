# Personal Budget Dashboard

This project is simply a way for me to exercise my habit of over-engineering certain ideas into something useful. The app itself is a monthly personal budget tracker with spending by category displayed right on the main page. The UI is inspired by You Need a Budget ([YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/)) and built with [React](https://reactjs.org) and [Ant Design](https://ant.design).

The back end is build with .NET and SQL Server. You can check out the code .NET code here: [https://github.com/burke1791/budget-api](https://github.com/burke1791/budget-api). I don't have the database in source control, but I believe I cover its architecture in sufficient detail in the API repo.

## Who is this for?

Me. I do not intend to release this for public use because I don't want to pay for a web server and a DB server. I MIGHT release a demo site with all of the back end functionality packed into service workers, but right now I don't see that as worth the effort.
